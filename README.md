# PostHog DotNet Client SDK ![Build status](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-dotnet/actions/workflows/main.yaml/badge.svg?branch=main)

This repository contains a set of packages for interacting with the PostHog API in .NET applications. 
This README is for those who wish to contribute to these packages.

For documentation on the specific packages, see the README files in the respective package directories.

## Packages

| Package | Version | Description
|---------|---------| -----------
| [PostHog.AspNetCore](src/PostHog.AspNetCore/README.md) | [![NuGet version (PostHog.AspNetCore)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/PostHog.AspNetCore.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PostHog.AspNetCore/) | For use in ASP.NET Core projects.
| [PostHog](src/PostHog/README.md) | [![NuGet version (PostHog)](https://img.shields.io/nuget/v/PostHog.svg?style=flat-square)](https://www.nuget.org/packages/PostHog/)                                  | The core library. Over time, this will support client environments such as Unit, Xamarin, etc.

> [!WARNING]  
> These packages are currently in a pre-release stage. We're making them available publicly to solicit 
> feedback. While we always strive to maintain a high level of quality, use these packages at your own 
> risk. There *will* be many breaking changes until we reach a stable release.

## Platform

These packages currently target `net9.0`. Our goal is to port the [PortHog](./src/PostHog/README.md) package to `netstandard2.1` at some point once we have a sample that requires it (for example, a Unity sample).

## Building

To build the solution, run the following commands in the root of the repository:

```bash
$ dotnet restore
$ dotnet build
```

## Samples

Sample projects are located in the `samples` directory.

To run the samples, you'll need to set your PostHog project API key. From the repository root you can run:

```bash
bin/user-secrets set PostHog:ProjectApiKey YOUR_API_KEY
```

The main ASP.NET Core sample app can be run with the following command:

```bash
$ bin/start
```

You can also run it from your favorite IDE or editor.

## Testing

To run the tests, run the following command in the root of the repository:

```bash
$ dotnet test
```

## PUBLISHING RELEASES

When it's time to cut a release, increment the version element at the top of [`Directory.Build.props`](Directory.Build.props) according to the [Semantic Versioning](http://semver.org/) guidelines.

```xml
<Project>
    <PropertyGroup>
        <Version>0.0.1</Version>
        ...
    </PropertyGroup>
</Project>
```

Submit a pull request with the version change. Once the PR is merged, create a new tag for the release with the updated version number.

```bash
git tag v0.5.5
git push --tags
```

Now you can go to GitHub to [Draft a new Release](https://github.com/Posthog/posthog-dotnet/releases/new) and click the button to "Auto-generate release notes". Edit the notes accordingly create the Release.

When you create the Release, the [`main.yml`](../.github/.workflow.release.yml) workflow builds and publishes the package to NuGet.

> ![IMPORTANT]
> When creating a release, it's important to create and publish it in one go. If you save a draft of the release and
> then later publish it, the workflow will not run. If you find yourself in that position, you can [manually trigger the workflow run](https://github.com/PostHog/posthog-dotnet/actions/workflows/main.yaml)
> and select the tag to publish.

## Usage

Inject the `IPostHogClient` interface into your controller or page:

```csharp
posthogClient.CaptureEvent(userId, "user signed up", new() { ["plan"] = "pro" });
}
```

```csharp
client.CapturePageView(userId, Request.Path.Value ?? "Unknown");
```

### Identity

#### Identify a user

See the [Identifying users](https://posthog.com/docs/product-analytics/identify) for more information about identifying users.

Identifying a user typically happens on the front-end. For example, when an authenticated user logs in, you can call `identify` to associate the user with their previously anonymous actions.

When `identify` is called the first-time for a distinct id, PostHog will create a new user profile. If the user already exists, PostHog will update the user profile with the new data. So the typical usage of `IdentifyAsync` here will be to update the person properties that PostHog knows about your user.

```csharp
await posthogClient.IdentifyAsync(
    userId,
    new() 
    {
        ["email"] = "haacked@posthog.com",
        ["name"] = "Phil Haack",
        ["plan"] = "pro"
    });
```

#### Alias a user

Use the `Alias` method to associate one identity with another. This is useful when a user logs in and you want to associate their anonymous actions with their authenticated actions.

```csharp
await posthogClient.AliasAsync(sessionId, userId);
```

### Analytics

#### Capture an Event

Note that capturing events is designed to be fast and done in the background. You can configure how often batches are sent to the PostHog API using the `FlushAt` and `FlushInterval` settings.

```csharp
posthogClient.CaptureEvent(userId, "user signed up", new() { ["plan"] = "pro" });
```

#### Capture a Page View

```csharp
posthogClient.CapturePageView(userId, Request.Path.Value ?? "Unknown");
```

#### Capture a Screen View

```csharp
posthogClient.CaptureScreen(userId, "Main Screen");
```

### Feature Flags

#### Check if feature flag is enabled

Check if the `awesome-new-feature` feature flag is enabled for the user with the id `userId`.

```csharp
var enabled = await posthogClient.IsFeatureEnabledAsync(userId, "awesome-new-feature");
```

You can override properties of the user stored on PostHog servers for the purposes of feature flag evaluation. 
For example, suppose you offer a temporary pro-plan for the duration of the user's session. You might do this:

```csharp
if (await posthogClient.IsFeatureEnabledAsync(
    userId,
    "pro-feature",
    new FeatureFlagOptions { PersonProperties = new() { ["plan"] = "pro" })) 
{
    // Access to pro feature
}
```

If you have group analytics enabled, you can also override group properties.

```csharp
if (await posthogClient.IsFeatureEnabledAsync(
    userId,
    "large-project-feature",
    new FeatureFlagOptions 
    {
        GroupProperties = new Group("project", "project-group-key", new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            ["size"] = "large"
        }))) 
{
    // Access large project features
}
```

> [!NOTE]
> Specifying `PersonProperties` and `GroupProperties` is necessary when using local evaluation of feature flags.

### Get a single Feature Flag

Some feature flags may have associated payloads.

```csharp
if (await posthogClient.GetFeatureFlagAsync(userId, "awesome-new-feature") is { Payload: {} payload })
{
    // Do something with the payload.
    Console.WriteLine($"The payload is: {payload}");
}
```

### Get All Feature Flags

Using information on the PostHog server.

```csharp
var flags = await posthogClient.GetFeatureFlagsAsync(userId);
```

Overriding the groups for the current user.

```csharp
var flags = await postHogClient.GetFeatureFlagsAsync(
    userId,
    personProperties: null,
    groupProperties:
    [
        new Group("project", "aaaa-bbbb-cccc", new Dictionary<string, object>
        {
            ["$group_key"] = "aaaa-bbbb-cccc",
            ["size"] = ProjectSize ?? "large"
        })
    ],
    cancellationToken: HttpContext.RequestAborted);
```
